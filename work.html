        As a <b>Business Architecture Analyst</b> at Accenture Song, I worked on a groundbreaking campaign for a leading client in the food & beverage industry, enabling users to create AI-generated personalized images through DALL-E, which could be shared directly on social media. I helped develop and implement robust data metrics to track the campaign's effectiveness, driving a ~25% increase in social media engagement. Leveraging tools like A/B Testing, Google Analytics, and Looker, I conducted extensive user research to uncover content creation behaviors, translating insights into product features that encouraged user-generated content submissions. Collaborating with creative teams using Adobe Creative Cloud and engineering teams leveraging REST APIs, I ensured seamless integration of user-generated AI content, creating a highly interactive and engaging social media experience.
